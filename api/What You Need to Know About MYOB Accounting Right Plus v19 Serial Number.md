# How to Find and Change Your MYOB AccountRight Plus V19 Serial Number
 
A serial number is a unique 12-digit ID that identifies your software. MYOB provides you with a serial number when you purchase AccountRight Plus V19, a powerful accounting software that helps you manage your business finances. You can enter your serial number when creating or activating a new company file. But what if you need to find or change your serial number? Here are some tips to help you out.

## Finding your serial number
 
If you purchased AccountRight Plus V19 from a retail store, you'll find your serial number on the point-of-sale activation (POSA) card or voucher that came with your product. You'll need to redeem your redemption code at [myob.com/redeem](https://myob.com/redeem) to get your serial number. Redemption codes are not the same as a serial number and have a different format (15 characters with a mix of letters and numbers, instead of a serial number's 12 digits).
 
If you purchased AccountRight Plus V19 online from the MYOB website, you'll find your serial number in the email confirming your purchase. If you downloaded a trial version, you'll find your serial number in the email confirming your download.
 
If you already have AccountRight Plus V19 installed on your computer, you can also find your serial number by opening the software and going to **Help > About MYOB AccountRight**. The serial number will be displayed on the About window.
 
## Changing the serial number in your company file
 
If you need to change the serial number in your company file, for example, if you upgraded your software or purchased a new license, you can do so by following these steps:
 
1. Open the company file that you want to change the serial number for.
2. Go to **Setup > Company Information**.
3. Click on the **Change Serial Number** button at the bottom of the window.
4. Enter the new serial number and click **OK**.
5. Close and reopen the company file to apply the changes.

Note: If the Change Serial Number function is not available, it means that your company file is online or linked to an online service. You'll need to disconnect or unlink your company file from the online service before you can change the serial number.
