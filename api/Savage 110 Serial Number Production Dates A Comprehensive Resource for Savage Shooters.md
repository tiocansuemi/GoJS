If you own a Savage 110 rifle and want to know when it was made, you can use the serial number to find out. The serial number is usually located on the left side of the receiver, behind the bolt handle. The serial number may have a letter prefix that indicates the year of manufacture, or it may have no prefix at all.
 
The letter prefix system was introduced by Savage in October 1968 to comply with the Gun Control Act of 1968, which required firearms manufacturers to include a serial number on every gun. The letter prefix signifies the approximate date range when the rifle was made, as shown in the table below:

| Letter Prefix | Start Date | End Date |
| --- | --- | --- |

| A | October 1968 | February 1972 |

| B | February 1972 | September 1975 |

| C | September 1975 | February 1979 |

| D | February 1979 | July 1982 |

| E | July 1982 | May 1989 |

| F | May 1989 | November 2001 |

| G | November 2001 | December 2009 |

| H | December 2009 | May (?) 2013 |

| J | May (?) 2013 | ?? |

| K | ?? | Late 2018 (?) |

| N | Late 2018 to Early 2019 |  |

Note that L and M were skipped as letter prefixes, because they could be easily confused with I or 1. M was also used exclusively for the Savage 10ML and 10ML-II muzzleloaders.
  
If your Savage 110 rifle has no letter prefix, it means it was made before October 1968, and you will have to use other clues to date it more precisely. One clue is the model number, which may indicate the year or decade when the rifle was introduced. For example, the Savage 110E was introduced in 1963, and the Savage 110H in 1966. Another clue is the stock design, which may have changed over time. For example, some early Savage 110 rifles had smooth hardwood stocks, while later models had stamped checkering on the stocks.
  
A more accurate way to date your Savage 110 rifle without a letter prefix is to use the date code that is stamped on the lever above the serial number. This date code is only found on Savage 99 rifles from 1949 to 1970, but it may also apply to some Savage 110 rifles from that period. The date code consists of a letter inside an oval stamp preceded by one or two numbers. The numbers indicate the inspector who checked the rifle, and the letter indicates the year of manufacture according to this chart:

| Date Code Letter | Year of Manufacture |
| --- | --- |

| A or B |<t

Another innovation that Savage introduced for the 110 series in 2003 was the AccuStock, which is a synthetic stock with an aluminum spine that runs from the action to the fore-end. The AccuStock provides a rigid and stable platform for the action and barrel, enhancing accuracy and consistency. The AccuStock also features a wedge-shaped block that locks the action into the stock, eliminating any movement or play.

The Savage 110 rifle has been praised for its accuracy, reliability, and affordability by many hunters, shooters, and reviewers. It has also been used by law enforcement and military units around the world, such as the Canadian Rangers, who adopted the Savage Model 10 as their standard patrol rifle in 2017. The Savage 110 rifle has also been customized and modified by many gunsmiths and enthusiasts, who have taken advantage of its simple and versatile design.

The Savage 110 rifle is a testament to the vision and ingenuity of its designer, Nicholas L. Brewer, who created a rifle that has stood the test of time and adapted to the changing needs and preferences of generations of shooters. The Savage 110 rifle is not only a classic American firearm, but also a living legend in the history of bolt-action rifles.
