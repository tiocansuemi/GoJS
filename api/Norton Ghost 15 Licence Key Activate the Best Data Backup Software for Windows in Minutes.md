Norton Ghost 15 is a powerful data backup and recovery software that allows you to create full or partial backups of your system, applications, settings, and files. You can also restore your system to a previous state in case of a disaster, such as a virus attack, hardware failure, or human error. However, to use Norton Ghost 15, you need to activate it with a valid licence key.
 
A licence key is a unique code that proves you have purchased the software legally and grants you access to its features. You can obtain a licence key by buying Norton Ghost 15 from the official website or from a trusted retailer. Alternatively, you can use one of the free serial numbers that are available online, but this is not recommended as it may violate the terms of service and expose you to security risks.

This feature allows you to test different software configurations, troubleshoot problems, or migrate to a new hardware platform without affecting your original system.
