## What is Commandline.txt?
 
Commandline.txt is a text file that you can create and place in the game's main folder, where PlayGTAIV.exe is located. This file allows you to enter some commands that modify the game's behavior and graphics options. You can use commandline.txt to override some of the restrictions that the game imposes on your graphics settings, or to enable some features that are not available in the game's menu.
 
## How to Create and Use Commandline.txt?
 
Creating and using commandline.txt is very easy. Here are the steps:
 
1. Open Notepad or any other text editor.
2. Type the commands that you want to use in the file. Each command should be on a separate line, starting with a dash (-). You can find a list of all available commands below.
3. Save the file as commandline.txt and place it in the game's main folder, where PlayGTAIV.exe is located.
4. Launch GTA IV over Steam or Rockstar Games Launcher.
5. Enjoy your customized graphics settings.

## List of Available Commands
 
Here are some of the most useful commands that you can use in commandline.txt:

- -nomemrestrict: Disable memory restrictions.
- -norestrictions: Do not limit graphics settings.
- -availablevidmem X: Set amount of physical video memory in megabytes (MB). For example, if you have a 6 GB graphics card, use -availablevidmem 6144.

You can find more commands by using the command -help in commandline.txt, which will show you a full list of available commands in a window when you launch the game. However, this will prevent the game from starting, so you have to delete the command after taking a screenshot or writing down the commands that you want to use.
